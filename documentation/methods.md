1. **Get duration in months:** Converts the duration of a job from LinkedIn's text format to a number of months, facilitating manipulation on the frontend. For example, "2 years 6 months" will be converted to 18.
1. **Get image:** Verifies if the candidate or company picture is a real image or a placeholder. It returns only real images, as we plan to use our own, stylized placeholders in the frontend.
1. Get primary job: People usually write multiple jobs in their description. This function returns the first job mentioned.
1. Get text: Cleans the text retrieved from LinkedIn by removing multiple empty lines and spaces.

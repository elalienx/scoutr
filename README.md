# Installation

1. Clone this Git repository into your computer.
1. Download and install Docker. I recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to setup everything for you.
1. Open the terminal in the directory containing this README file and execute `docker compose up --build`
1. Open your browser and type this address: [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The Docker installation takes time to install everything, so don't open [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050) until you see these messages in the terminal:

```

# This file is for the production version of the project.
# In the file frontend/Dockerfile.production we tell Docker to build the React file using Vite.
# Then we tell to copy the dist folder and this default.config file to the ngix folder as the frontend is now just static files.
# Finally the configuration listed below allows index.html to listen to port 5173 so it can make the api calls.
